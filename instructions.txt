Adding a new "past production"
  1. In company-site/_productions:
    Create a new document with the naming convention: production_name_YYYY.md
  2. Open up the new file that you just created
  3. Copy/paste this into the new document that you just created:
  
---
layout: production   
title:  
dates: 
location: 
synopsis:
 
production:  
- name:      
  title:
  bio_url:
- name:      
  title:
  bio_url:

cast:
- actor:     
  role:    
  actor_bio_url:
- actor:     
  role:    
  actor_bio_url:

images: 
- url:
---
        
  4. You will need a name, title, bio_url for each member of the production crew AND you will need an actor, role, actor_bio_url for each actor in the performance (if a given person does not have personal bio page, you can remove that key all together)
  5. If you need a visual example of how this should look, you can open up a file that already exists for a different past performance. Make sure the information you plugged into your new file matches the formatting of the other .md files in _performances.
  6. You're done!
