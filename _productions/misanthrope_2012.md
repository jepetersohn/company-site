synopsis: Before there was political correctness, there was Alceste, whose blunt truthfulness embarrasses his friends and makes him tremendously unpopular within respectable society.  But there is the honest woman Eliante who pins for him, and Célimène who lusts after him, which leads to quirky flirtations, ripping heartbreaks, and a comedic exile.
